Introduction
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the 'skeleton' of the web. If CSS 'dresses up' your HTML and JavaScript brings it to life, HTML is the body of your web application. HTML's syntax even reflects that idea, as it includes "head", "body", and "footer" tags.

One html tag that doesn't need a closing tag is the <img> tag, because it has a src element that contains all the information the page needs to render the item.
