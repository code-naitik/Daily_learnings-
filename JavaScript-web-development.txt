Declaring variables in JavaScript:
there are three ways to do that:- 1. var one = 1; var is function scope also can be changed in scope available before declaration.
2. let two = 2; let is block scope also it can be changed in scope only available after decalaration.
3. const three = 3; const is block scope , it cannot be changed , only available after decalaration.

Data types in JavaScript:
Primitive Data Types
These are immutable and stored directly in the variable.

1.String

Textual data

e.g. "hello", 'JavaScript'

2.Number

Numeric values (both integers and floating point)

e.g. 42, 3.14

3.BigInt

For very large integers beyond Number limits

e.g. 9007199254740991n

4.Boolean

Logical true/false

e.g. true, false

5.undefined

Variable declared but no value assigned

e.g. let x; console.log(x); // undefined

6.null

Intentional “no value”

e.g. let y = null;

7.Symbol

Unique, immutable identifier

e.g. const sym = Symbol('id');

1.Object

Collections of key-value pairs

e.g.

js
Copy
Edit
const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
2.Array

Ordered list-like objects

e.g.

js
Copy
Edit
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
3.Function

Callable objects

e.g.

js
Copy
Edit
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
4.Date, RegExp, Map, Set, etc.

Built-in objects for special purposes

Stored directly in the variable.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                             
Immutable (can’t be changed directly).                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                   
Simple values. 



Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Stored as references (address in memory).

Can hold multiple values or complex data.

Mutable (can change contents).
