GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant. It helps you write code faster and with fewer errors by suggesting:

 Code completions – It predicts the next few lines or even whole functions as you type.
 Code snippets – It suggests common patterns or boilerplate code for various tasks.
 Function or comment completion – Write a comment describing what you want, and Copilot tries to generate the corresponding code.
 Learning new APIs – It suggests how to use libraries or frameworks you might not know well.

It works directly in code editors like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and some JetBrains IDEs.

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI’s models (originally Codex, now more advanced versions). It’s trained on a huge dataset of publicly available code and natural language.
