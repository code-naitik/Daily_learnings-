GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant. It helps you write code faster and with fewer errors by suggesting:

 Code completions – It predicts the next few lines or even whole functions as you type.
 Code snippets – It suggests common patterns or boilerplate code for various tasks.
 Function or comment completion – Write a comment describing what you want, and Copilot tries to generate the corresponding code.
 Learning new APIs – It suggests how to use libraries or frameworks you might not know well.

It works directly in code editors like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and some JetBrains IDEs.

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI’s models (originally Codex, now more advanced versions). It’s trained on a huge dataset of publicly available code and natural language.


Using GitHub Copilot with JavaScript:
GitHub copilot suggests code completions, entire functions, and even complex logic based on comments or partially written code. Integrated into editors like Visual Studio Code, Copilot analyzes the context of your JavaScript files and offers intelligent suggestions, saving time on boilerplate code and helping discover new patterns or APIs. However, it’s important to review Copilot’s suggestions carefully to ensure correctness and security in your code.
Complete a function from a comment

You type:

// Function to check if a number is prime
function isPrime(n) {
Copilot might suggest:

    if (n <= 1) return false;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}


What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear instructions to guide AI systems, like GitHub Copilot, to generate context-appropriate code tailored to your project's specific needs. This ensures the code is syntactically, functionally, and contextually correct.

Best practices in prompt engineering:
The following advanced practices, based on the 4 Ss, refine and enhance your engagement with Copilot, ensuring that the generated code isn't only accurate but perfectly aligned with your project's specific needs and contexts.
