Introduction
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, solve an important problem of web development: how to make your web site look nice. Styling your apps makes them more usable and nicer-looking; you can also use CSS to create Responsive Web Design (RWD) - allowing your apps to look good no matter what screen size they are displayed on. CSS is not only about making your app look nice; its spec includes animations and transforms that can enable sophisticated interactions for your apps.
