Introduction
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, solve an important problem of web development: how to make your web site look nice. Styling your apps makes them more usable and nicer-looking; you can also use CSS to create Responsive Web Design (RWD) - allowing your apps to look good no matter what screen size they are displayed on. CSS is not only about making your app look nice; its spec includes animations and transforms that can enable sophisticated interactions for your apps.
The Cascade:
Cascading Style Sheets incorporate the idea that the styles 'cascade' such that the application of a style is guided by its priority. Styles set by a web site author take priority over those set by a browser. Styles set 'inline' take priority over those set in an external style sheet.
Inheritance:
Styles are inherited from an ancestor style to a descendent, such that nested elements inherit the styles of their parents.

Tags
So far, your style.css file has only a few tags styled, and the app looks pretty strange:

body {
	font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
	color: #3a241d;
	text-align: center;
}

Ids
Add some style to layout the left and right containers. Since there is only one left container and only one right container, they are given ids in the markup. To style them, use #:

#left-container {
	background-color: #eee;
	width: 15%;
	left: 0px;
	top: 0px;
	position: absolute;
	height: 100%;
	padding: 10px;
}

#right-container {
	background-color: #eee;
	width: 15%;
	right: 0px;
	top: 0px;
	position: absolute;
	height: 100%;
	padding: 10px;
}
Classes:
In the example above, you styled two unique elements on the screen. If you want styles to apply to many elements on the screen, you can use CSS classes. Do this to layout the plants in the left and right containers.

Notice that each plant in the HTML markup has a combination of ids and classes. The ids here are used by the JavaScript that you will add later to manipulate the terrarium plant placement. The classes, however, give all the plants a given style.

<div class="plant-holder">
	<img class="plant" alt="plant" id="plant1" src="./images/plant1.png" />
</div>
